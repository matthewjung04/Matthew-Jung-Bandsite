                    <span>
                        The Bees Knees is a pop rock band originating from San Francisco, California. The band
                        consists a dynamic lineup featuring two lead vocalists, two guitarists, a bassist,
                        a keyboardist and a drummer. The band achieved its first commercial success as an unsigned
                        act, drawing attention from their future manager. Having extensive experience working
                        with both new and seasoned acts, the manager was confident the band could succeed even
                        further with more support, pushing The Bees Knees to sign with a well known record label.
                    </span>
                    <span>
                        From there, the band has soared, gaining international recognition and ranking in the top
                        10 on the Poster Charts. New fans immediately fell in love with the band’s original and
                        organic attitude, solidifying their place as one of the hottest and fastest up and coming
                        acts of this century. Fans affectionately refer to themselves as “The Hive” and are drawn
                        to their candid and authentic performances on stage. The Bees Knees are currently recording
                        their second studio album, looking to be released in early 2024.
